"make" will build an a.out from fmain.F90 and prbits.c. Running a.out will
ask 32-bit vs 64-bit, then numerator and denominator. It will then use
prbits.c to print in binary and hex values.

You can then mouse the appropriate output into the appropriate portions of
testbits.c or testbits.F90, compile, and see what gets printed.
