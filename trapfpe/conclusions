For all: For gdb to print line number info, compile routine(s) with -g

GNU:
Fortran main:
  To stop on FPE: Must compile mprog with -ffpe-trap=invalid,zero,overflow
  -rdynamic is NOT needed in LDFLAGS
C main:
  To print useful backtrace, i.e. include function names: LDFLAGS += -rdynamic

Intel:
Fortran main:
  To stop on FPE: Compile with -fpe0
  To print useful backtrace, compile with -traceback
C main:
  To print useful backtrace, LDFLAGS += -rdynamic
  -fpe0 not mandatory to catch exception or print backtrace, but useful otherwise

PGI:
Forrtan main:
  To stop on FPE: Compile with -Ktrap=fp
C main:
  To stop on FPE: Compile with -Ktrap=fp
  To print useful backtrace, LDFLAGS += -rdynamic
