INPUTS:
start_mo column is for the START of that month
end_mo column is for the END of that month

OUTPUTS:
*_value (thousands) columns come from ../../NOTES.*
"spent" (K dollars) comes from running "spent expenses.<year>.txt" in ../expenditures
  It is $ spent from start_mo to end_mo of that year
"mo_annuity_income" is monthly lifetime annuity income (K dollars) and is currently just UCAR.
   Could add Social Security? But so far I'm ignoring that.
Inflation is % from start_mo through end_mo and is derived from
 www.statbureau.org/en/united-states/cpi-u
 Calculate as (end_cpi - start_cpi) / start_cpi
NOTE: year 2023 started UCAR annuity in September, which zeroed the accumulation at TIAA. So,
 changed start_assets to subtract the $306K that disappeared from the accumulation when the annuity
 started. On 10/12/2023 modified predict.c to read in the monthly annuity value, and include its
 current value in the calculation of "ramp to zero". Verified that prior year computations remained
 the same with the new code (as it should be since mo_annuity_income is zero for all those years)
